# Jarve
Jarvis-Edge: Sovereign LLM Intelligence on Legacy Silicon. Achieved stable 0.6 t/s deployment on an Intel Celeron with only 2GB RAM. This project bypasses standard OS overhead via a custom C++ environment (PID 1) to prove that high-level AI logic is possible without high-end hardware. A study in extreme resource optimization and hardware autonomy.
