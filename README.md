# Jarve
Jarvis-Edge: Sovereign LLM Intelligence on Legacy Silicon. Achieved stable 0.6 t/s deployment on an Intel Celeron with only 2GB RAM. This project bypasses standard OS overhead via a custom C++ environment (PID 1) to prove that high-level AI logic is possible without high-end hardware. A study in extreme resource optimization and hardware autonomy.

Jarve: Sovereign Intelligence on Legacy Silicon
​Architect: navin3140m-architect
​📡 The Five Pillars of the Jarve System
​1. Why Offline AI? (The "Rendering" Philosophy)
​In an emergency, a database is just a static warehouse. A human can find data, but only an AI can process and render it into actionable intelligence. When the internet is dead, Jarve acts as a local brain to process my family's needs instantly.
​2. Radical RAM Management (The "Oxygen" Method)
​To run an LLM on 2GB RAM, I eliminated every millisecond of waste:
​OS Stripping: Started with MX Linux (600MB), then stripped the GUI to reach 400MB.
​Driver Optimization: Bypassed the 300MB overhead used by Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and peripherals.
​Direct Boot: I configured the system to reboot directly into the Jarve terminal. This leaves 1.2GB of "Oxygen"—pure breathing space for the model to think without system lag.
​3. Why C++? (Talking to the Metal)
​Python is a guest in the house; C++ is the owner. I chose C++ because it is the only language that can directly talk to the hardware. By bypassing high-level abstractions, I ensured that every clock cycle of the Intel Celeron is dedicated to inference.
​4. The 1B vs 3B Choice (Latency over Ego)
​While a 3B model is "smarter," it would take 10 minutes to respond on this processor. A 1B model responds in 2-3 minutes. In a sovereign system, speed is a feature. I chose the 1B model to ensure the AI is a tool, not a burden.
​5. Rejecting Virtual RAM (The Silicon Life Rule)
​I refused to use a Pendrive for "Swap" space. Even though it gives more "breathing space," a Pendrive is not RAM. Under continuous AI load, the high IOPS would kill the silicon in 2 to 8 months. For a system meant for a "Bunker" or long-term family use, longevity is more important than temporary speed.
